Overview:
    The purpose of this analysis is to create a tool for a nonprofit foundation called Alphabet
Soup that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded. We are given a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.  Within this dataset there are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, including:

-EIN and NAME—Identification columns
-APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
-AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
-CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
-USE_CASE—Use case for funding
-ORGANIZATION—Organization type
-STATUS—Active status
-INCOME_AMT—Income classification
-SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
-ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
-IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Using this information we are making a machine learning model using neural networks that can predict accurately whether or not an organization will be successful if funded.
